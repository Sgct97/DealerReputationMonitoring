# Testing Guide

This directory contains test scripts to verify each component of the Dealer Reputation Keeper works correctly.

## Before You Test

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Make sure you're in the project root directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Your `.env` File

You need to configure your API keys and settings. The `.env` file is in the project root.

**Minimum configuration for testing:**

```env
# For Database Test (no API keys needed)
DATABASE_PATH=./data/reviews.db

# For AI Test (you need this)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key

# For Email Test (you need these)
GMAIL_ADDRESS=youremail@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password
TO_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
```

### 3. Get Your API Keys

**OpenAI API Key:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new key
3. Copy it to your `.env` file

**Gmail App Password:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Create a new app password for "Mail"
4. Copy the 16-character password to your `.env` file
5. See `GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Run All Tests (Recommended)

From the project root directory:

```bash
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

This will run all three tests in sequence with pauses between each.

### Option 2: Run Individual Tests

**Test Database Only** (no API keys needed):
```bash
python tests/test_database.py
```

**Test AI Analysis** (needs OpenAI API key):
```bash
python tests/test_ai.py
```

**Test Email Notifications** (needs Gmail credentials):
```bash
python tests/test_email.py
```

## What Each Test Does

### 1. Database Test (`test_database.py`)
- Creates a test SQLite database
- Adds a sample review
- Tests duplicate prevention
- Tests retrieval and stats
- **No API keys required**

### 2. AI Analysis Test (`test_ai.py`)
- Connects to OpenAI
- Analyzes 3 sample fake reviews
- Returns reporting categories and reasoning
- **Requires:** Valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Cost:** ~$0.01 per test run

### 3. Email Test (`test_email.py`)
- Sends a test email via Gmail SMTP
- Uses sample review data
- **Requires:** Valid `GMAIL_ADDRESS`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `TO_EMAIL`
- **Important:** Check your inbox to verify the email looks good!
- **Free!** Gmail allows 500 emails/day

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'playwright'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Missing required environment variables"
- Check that your `.env` file exists in the project root
- Verify all required keys are filled in (not the placeholder values)

### "OpenAI API error"
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check you have credits available: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Make sure your key has permissions to use the API

### "Gmail email failed"
- Verify you're using an **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
- Remove spaces from the App Password
- Verify `GMAIL_ADDRESS` is correct
- Make sure 2-Factor Authentication is enabled on your Google account
- See `GMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting

### Email doesn't arrive
- Check your spam folder
- Verify the `TO_EMAIL` is correct
- Check your Gmail "Sent" folder to confirm it was sent

## Expected Output

### âœ… Successful Test Run

```
ðŸ”¹ TEST 1/3: Database Module
âœ“ Database initialized successfully
âœ“ Review added successfully
âœ“ Review found in database
âœ“ Duplicate prevention working correctly
...
âœ… All Database Tests Passed!

ðŸ”¹ TEST 2/3: AI Analysis Module
âœ“ OpenAI API key loaded
âœ“ AI analyzer initialized
âœ“ Category: Spam
âœ“ Reasoning: ...
âœ… All AI Analysis Tests Passed!

ðŸ”¹ TEST 3/3: Email Notification Module
âœ“ Email configuration loaded
âœ“ Email sent successfully!
âœ… Email Test Completed!

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Your system is ready.
```

## Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:
1. âœ… Your database is working
2. âœ… Your AI analysis is working
3. âœ… Your email notifications are working

The only remaining step is to complete the scraper by finding the Google review selectors (see `FINDING_SELECTORS.md` in the project root).
